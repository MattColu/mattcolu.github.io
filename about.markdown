## I'm Matteo Colucci,
# Developer, aspiring 3D artist
# Video game enthusiast, car enthusiast, music enthusiast.

I like learning about things.

This is my personal portfolio site, it's still very much a WIP and I am not really sure what I'll put on it.

For now I am working on setting up a nice summary of all the important projects I've worked on, and a showcase of some smaller things I'm also proud of.

If you've taken the time to read all this, thank you!
